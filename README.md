# Maps
> Written by Lewis Kim

### Description

Maps is a restaurant ratings visualizer (in Berkeley) that constructs a Voronoi diagram, using k-means clustering. In the diagram, Berkeley is segmented into regions, where each region is shaded by the predicted rating of the closest restaurant (yellow = 5 stars, blue = 1 star). Each restaurant is represented by a dot, and the color of the dot is determined by the restaurant's location in Berkeley.

The data for this project is from the [Yelp Academic Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset).
